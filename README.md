# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts
```

Local Setup:

1. Install remixd globally or within the project: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@remix-project/remixd
2. Run `remixd -s ./shared_project -u https://remix.ethereum.org` to share the project folder to remixd
